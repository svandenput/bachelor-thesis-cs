We start analytically by ﬁrst studying (a) the tightness aspects of the standard hybrid {KEM}+{DEM} encryption paradigm, (b) the inherent weak security properties of all deterministic {DEMs} due to generic key-collision attacks in the multi-instance setting, and (c) the negative eﬀect of deterministic {DEMs} on the security of hybrid encryption.},

	abstract = {In the context of authenticated encryption ({AE}), generic composition has referred to the construction of an {AE} scheme by gluing together a conventional (privacy-only) encryption scheme and a {MAC}. Since the work of Bellare and Namprempre (2000) and then Krawczyk (2001), the conventional wisdom has become that there are three forms of generic composition, with Encrypt-then-{MAC} the only one that generically works. However, many caveats to this understanding have surfaced over the years. Here we explore this issue further, showing how this understanding oversimpliﬁes the situation because it ignores the results’ sensitivity to deﬁnitional choices. When encryption is formalized diﬀerently, making it either {IV}-based or nonce-based, rather than probabilistic, and when the {AE} goal is likewise changed to take in a nonce, qualitatively diﬀerent results emerge. We explore these alternatives versions of the generic-composition story. We also evidence the overreaching understanding of prior genericcomposition results by pointing out that the Encrypt-then-{MAC} mechanism of {ISO} 19772 is completely wrong.},

	title = {Generalized Initialization of the Duplex Construction},
	abstract = {The duplex construction is already well analyzed with many papers proving its security in the random permutation model. However, so far, the first phase of the duplex, where the state is initialized with a secret key and an initialization vector ({IV} ), is typically analyzed in a worst case manner. More detailed, it is always assumed that the adversary is allowed to choose the {IV} on its will. In this paper, we analyze how the security changes if restrictions on the choice of the {IV} are imposed, varying from the global nonce case over the random {IV} case to the {IV} on key case. The last one, in particular, is the duplex analogue of the use of a nonce masked with a secret in {AES}-{GCM} in {TLS} 1.3. We apply our findings to duplex-based encryption and authenticated encryption, and discuss the practical applications of our results.},
